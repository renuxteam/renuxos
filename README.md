# **Renux OS**

Renux OS is a complete **Unix-like operating system** written in **Rust**. This project aims to provide a **hybrid kernel** that can be extended with additional features as needed. The main focus is to learn and explore developing an operating system in **Rust**.

## 🚀 **Future Plans**

To see our plans and the future of the Renux system, click [here](docs/plans/future_plans.md).

## 🛠️ **Development Status**
> [!WARNING]
> Renux OS is currently in the **development phase**. Many features are still being implemented and tested. Contributions and feedback are welcome to help improve and expand the project.

## 📝 **Build this OS and Documentation**
For detailed instructions on how to build the operating system, including the documentation, visit the [docs](./docs/docs.md) directory.

## 🚀 **Future Versions**
- **Version 1.0 ("Aurora")**: Initial release for internal testing and community feedback.
- **Version 2.0 ("Jaguar")**: Public release with more features and enhanced stability.
- **Subsequent versions**: Alternating between **internal testing** and **public releases** to ensure continuous system evolution.

## 🔐 **Security**
- **Enhance the Kernel in Rust**: Implement additional security layers and memory control with Rust.
- **Add secure drivers**: Focus on driver security, transitioning from C to Zig for increased safety and efficiency.
- **Intelligent failure monitoring**: Develop an automated failure detection and recovery system.

## ⚡ **Performance**
- **Code and memory optimization**: Continue working on custom allocators to reduce memory fragmentation.
- **Modern driver in Zig**: Use Zig to create drivers that optimize performance while maintaining memory safety.
- **Faster and more efficient compilation**: Improve build processes using Cargo and Zig to reduce build time and enhance modularity.

## 🔄 **Language Integration**
- **Zig, Rust, C, and C++ in the system**: Continue integrating these languages effectively, leveraging the strengths of each:
  - **Rust** for the Kernel and secure memory management.
  - **Zig** for modern drivers, cross-compilation, and low-level optimizations.
  - **C/C++** for legacy hardware drivers and compatibility.

## 🌍 **Expansion and Contributions**
- **Open-source ecosystem**: Continue the evolution of Renux OS as an open-source project, encouraging contributions from developers and building a strong community.
- **Partnerships and collaborations**: Explore opportunities to collaborate with other operating system communities and open-source projects to share ideas and improve Renux OS.

## 🗂️ **Decentralized Codebase with Submodules**
The Renux OS codebase is designed to be **decentralized** through the use of **Git submodules**. This allows for the separation of different components of the operating system into **independent repositories**, while still maintaining a unified build process. By using submodules, the system's architecture can evolve more flexibly, with each module being developed and maintained independently, yet easily integrated into the main codebase.

## 💡 **Long-Term Goals**
- **Develop a modular architecture** that allows for fast and secure updates.
- **Expand compatibility** with various architectures and devices, including embedded systems and low-power devices.
- **Focus on continuous innovation**, surpassing traditional operating systems with **enhanced security**, **exceptional performance**, and **optimized user experience**.

## 🚀 **Conclusion**
Renux OS is designed to be a **modern, efficient, and secure** operating system. The integration of languages like Rust, Zig, C, and C++ offers incredible flexibility, while the focus on **security** and **performance** ensures that the system will become a **reference for the future of operating systems**.
